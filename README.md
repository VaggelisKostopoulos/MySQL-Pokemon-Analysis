# MySQL-Pokemon-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a Pokémon dataset using MySQL. The database contains a single table with comprehensive attributes for each Pokémon, including id, name, height, weight, types, moves, abilities, and stats.

I wrote and executed SQL queries to explore and analyze the dataset, performing tasks such as:

- Identifying the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful Pokémon.
- Aggregating and grouping by types to find averages and distributions and which type is the most common.
- Analyzing move sets and abilities to identify trends and unique characteristics.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex datasets, write optimized SQL queries, and extract actionable insights using aggregations, filtering, and sorting techniques.
